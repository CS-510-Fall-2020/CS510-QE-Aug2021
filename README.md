## Instructions for this exam

To begin the exam, accept the Github classroom assignment through the link provided during the exam period and follow the instructions to create your own repository using the provided code template.

This exam consists of two portions: essay questions and a coding
practical. 

 1. __Essay Questions__: in the file labeled "Essay-questions.pdf". Provide answers to these questions in the time period provided during the exam. Be sure to provide in-text citations and references to scholarly works that support your conclusions. 
 2. __Coding Practical__: in the folder labeled "practical". T This folder contains a coding project in R that completes a basic task. However, it has little documentation and runs slowly. Your tasks are to:
 	 * improve the documentation and structure of the code so that it successfully reproduces, similar to the rules in the course (these are repeated below). 
 	 * refactor the code so that it is more reader friendly. 
 	 * optimize the code for memory usage and speed. 
 	 * add additional functionality to the code (noted in the practical/README.md file).
Do the best you can in the time you have. You should use git to add commits to your directory as you work, I will review this history so do NOT neglect to commit your work as you go!  I will be assessing the code in the same way as the final projects, using this form: https://forms.gle/UiCwmAJca16uMwED9, also included in the main directory of this repository. (Note: You do not fill out this form, I do! But it is here for your reference.) 

To submit your work: 

 * To submit your essay question answers, turn in a digital copy of your answers by the end of the exam period by emailing them to waldrop@chapman.edu. (This should be a stand-alone file in rft, doc, docx, or pdf. NO LINKS TO GOOGLE DOCS.) The essay questions are due by the end of the exam period at __6:30 pm  PST on Aug 27 2021__. 
 * To submit your code practical, turn in the repository via Github Classroom assignment. The coding practical is due __11:59 pm PST on August 29 2021__.

__BE ADVISED__: No late work will be accepted, so please have your work be submitted on time.
